I am a student working in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. Currently, I'm pursuing my Masters degree at the University of Colorado Boulder. I'm a Machine Learning Data Scientist at the AI/ML team at [Reveal Data](https://www.revealdata.com), Chicago. Here, I'm working on extending multi-lingual capabilities to Reveal Data's deep learning based [e-discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_discovery) models. My work here is advised by Dr. Irina Matveeva.
# More specifically, I am investigating different fine-tuning regimes for multi-lingual BERT in the context of e-discovery and Technology Assisted Review [(TAR)](https://edrm.net/resources/frameworks-and-standards/technology-assisted-review/). 

I'm also research assistant at the [CLEAR Lab](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/clear/) at the University of Colorado, working with [Prof. Martha Palmer](https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/palmer-martha/), on DARPA's [KAIROS](https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2019-01-04) project (Knowledge-directed Artificial Intelligence Reasoning Over Schemas). My work involves investigation of conceptual similarity  algorithms for ontology-based partial similarity matching for Wikidata entities.

Previously, I have worked as a research assistant at the [GREYC Lab](https://www.greyc.fr/?page_id=29&lang=en) @ [University of Caen, Normandy](http://welcome.unicaen.fr/research/) in France, supervised by [Prof. GaÃ«l Dias](https://dias.users.greyc.fr/). My work here was focused on Patch-based Identification of Lexico-Semantic Relations.[Here](post/lexico-semantic/) is a basic summary. 

When time isn't tight, I like to read and learn about International Relations, public policy and macroeconomics.
